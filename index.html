          <h2>Consulting</h2>

          <p>
            My consulting journey has been marked by diverse experiences that
            have shaped my career as a civil engineer and surveyor. I began my
            international career at the Shanghai Municipal and Engineering
            Design Institute, where I worked on large-scale infrastructure
            projects, developing adaptability and cultural sensitivity.
          </p>

          <p>
            I served as a Geotechnical Engineer at GPD Group and Geotecnica,
            LLC, managing complex projects and emphasizing teamwork and
            communication. Here, I collaborated with experts in various fields
            to ensure the structural foundations were solid and sustainable.
          </p>

          <p>
            My career path also crossed Terracon Consultants, where I started as
            a staff engineer, learning the intricacies of geotechnical
            engineering and the importance of precision in soil analysis and
            foundation design. These experiences have collectively enriched my
            consulting journey, equipping me with a diverse skill set and a
            holistic approach to project management.

            One of my notable achievements in the realm of research is securing
            research funding as a Principal Investigator (PI) and co-PI, with a
            total grant amount exceeding $406,000 and more than 5 million RMB.
            These funds have been instrumental in supporting my research
            endeavors and have allowed me to explore novel approaches to solving
            complex problems in civil engineering and machine learning.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition to my research contributions, I authored a highly
            regarded textbook titled "Principles of Soil Dynamics, 3rd Edition,"
            co-authored with Professor Braja Das, and published by Cengage
            Learning in 2017. This comprehensive textbook has been a valuable
            resource for students and professionals in the field, offering
            insights into soil dynamics and its principles.
          </p>

          <h2>Professional Activities</h2>

          <p>
            In the realm of student services, I have actively served as a
            faculty mentor for various research projects. Notable among these is
            my role as a mentor for Isabella Sandino's project on "Application
            of Virtual Reality in Construction Safety Training" during the Lamar
            University Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) in 2023.
            Additionally, I provided guidance and support to Brandyn Wagstaff
            and Shawn Azarnoush, whose project on "Modular Construction:
            Benefits, Advantages and a Case Study" won 1st place in Lamar
            University Undergraduate EXPO in 2022. In 2021, I mentored Mario
            Cisneros, Noah McGallion, and Jesse Odom, whose research on
            "Productivity, Cost, and Safety Benefits of Concrete 3D Printing in
            the Construction Industry" earned them 2nd place in Lamar University
            Undergraduate EXPO.

          <p>
            Within the university, my contributions have been diverse and
            impactful. I have actively participated as a member of the
            University Admissions Committee at Lamar University, playing a role
            in shaping the institution's future through student admissions
            processes. My involvement extends to faculty-related initiatives as
            well, including serving as the Faculty Contact for the Kiewit
            University Relations & Student OSHA 10-Hour Certificate Training
            Program, fostering industry partnerships and promoting safety
            training among students. For several years, I dedicated my expertise
            to the role of Faculty Adviser for the Construction Management
            Student Association at Lamar University, facilitating the growth and
            development of aspiring construction professionals. Additionally,
            I've been a dedicated member of accreditation and assessment
            committees, contributing to the quality and standards of education
            at both the College of Business and the Construction Management
            Program at Lamar University. During my time at the University of
            Akron, I actively participated in committees related to graduate
            studies, seminars, student recruitment, and scholarships, further
            enhancing the academic experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            My academic contributions have extended beyond the classroom and
            into the broader academic community. I've served as a grant reviewer
            for the National Science Foundation, evaluating research proposals
            in my field. Additionally, I've been an active technical journal
            reviewer for numerous esteemed publications, including "Automation
            in Construction," "Canadian Geotechnical Journal," and many more. My
            commitment to advancing research is also evident through my role as
            a conference paper reviewer for conferences such as GeoExtreme,
            GeoCongress, and the International Symposium on Geotechnical Safety
            and Risk (ISGSR), among others. I've had the honor of chairing
            sessions at conferences like GeoCongress, GeoShanghai, and
            Geo-Risk/ISGSR, where I facilitated discussions and knowledge
            sharing among peers in the geotechnical and construction engineering
            fields.
